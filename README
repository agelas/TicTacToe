Basic tic-tac-toe game where the user can play against a cpu that picks positions at random or uses a deterministic implementation of the minimax algorithm-you can choose. The minimax algorithm works by minimizing the possible loss for a worst case situation. In the context of tic-tac-toe, it works by recursively checking all the possible moves the maximizing player (the computer) and the minimizing player (the user) can make from a given gameboard until one either wins or they tie.
